## Bop for Pure Data

![bop.png](bop.png)

*bop* is a suite of modules for computer music composition in Pure Data.  It implements conventions of Orac 2.0 with the aim of being somewhat cross compatible, though more focussed on composition than performance.  Modules should provide an easy to use GUI and state saving to *"make shit easy"*. 🐦 It's not vanilla compatible yet but that's also on the list... maybe it'll require cyclone... i dunno.
